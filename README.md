# About-Me

My name is Colin Michael and I have 5+ years experience utilizing data to generate actionable insights and decision-making. I also have extensive experience in client-facing roles, collaborating with partner teams to onboard clients onto data platforms, uncovering opportunity areas, and testing hypotheses. 

I enjoy using my combination of business acumen and technical skills to solve a variety of problems. I am passionate about data and am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Data Science.

Apart from my professional interests, I enjoy sports, exercise, going to the movies, and spending time with my golden retriever.
